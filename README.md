# Algorithms

A collection of programs intended to improvize understanding and familiarity with data-structures and algorithms.

Programs will be written in either Java, Python or C, depending on the
type of problem being solved.

* Simple short scripts are written in Python.
* More complex programs, whose clarity may be boosted by a
statically-typed language are written in Java.
* Any data structure implementation is best done in a low level
language that provides no in-built structures. Hence, they will
be written in C.
  
Each program can be executed from command-line.
